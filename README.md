# üîå ESP8266 Switch Client with Wi-Fi Control & Status Indicator

This project runs on a NodeMCU ESP8266 and works as a **Wi-Fi switch controller**. It connects to a Wi-Fi Access Point (`ESP8266_Relay`) and sends HTTP requests to control relays based on the physical switch states. Additionally, it uses **red and green status LEDs** to show the connection status to the access point.

## üì¶ Features

- üñ≤Ô∏è 4 Physical Switches connected to GPIOs
- üì° Connects to Access Point `ESP8266_Relay`
- üåê Sends HTTP requests to control relays
- üî¥ Red LED blinks continuously when not connected
- üü¢ Green LED blinks for 5 seconds every minute when connected
- üß† Switch state change detection (no redundant requests)
- ‚ö° Compatible with latest ESP8266 Arduino core (uses `WiFiClient` with `HTTPClient`)

## üåê Relay Control Endpoints

| Relay | ON Endpoint                    | OFF Endpoint                   |
|--------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1      | `http://192.168.4.1/relay1/on`  | `http://192.168.4.1/relay1/off` |
| 2      | `http://192.168.4.1/relay2/on`  | `http://192.168.4.1/relay2/off` |
| 3      | `http://192.168.4.1/relay3/on`  | `http://192.168.4.1/relay3/off` |
| 4      | `http://192.168.4.1/relay4/on`  | `http://192.168.4.1/relay4/off` |

> These endpoints are expected to be hosted by another NodeMCU or device configured as `ESP8266_Relay` in access point mode.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

- On boot, the ESP8266 tries to connect to `ESP8266_Relay` AP.
- If not connected, red LED blinks continuously.
- If connected, green LED blinks for 5 seconds every minute.
- The state of each switch is monitored:
  - When a switch is pressed (LOW), it sends an HTTP request to turn ON the corresponding relay.
  - When released (HIGH), it sends an HTTP request to turn OFF the corresponding relay.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Open the sketch in Arduino IDE.
2. Select the board: `NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)`
3. Install required libraries if not already installed:
   - `ESP8266WiFi`
   - `ESP8266HTTPClient`
4. Upload the sketch to your NodeMCU.
5. Power it and connect to your relay AP (`ESP8266_Relay`).
6. Open Serial Monitor to debug.
